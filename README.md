<h2>Language Translator Using Transformer model </h2>
<P>This is a comprehensive implementation of the Transformer architecture as described in the "Attention Is All You Need" paper. Here's a detailed break-down of the translation model: <be>
<h3>Model Architecture</h3>
  <img src="The-Transformer-model-architecture.png" alt="Transformer" width="500" height="600">
<p>
The model uses a standard Transformer architecture with the following components:<br>

Encoder: Comprising N layers, each with multi-head attention and feed-forward networks.<br>
Decoder: Similar to the encoder, with an additional attention mechanism to attend to the encoder output.<br>
Attention Mechanisms: Visualizing where the model focuses during translation.<br>
  
</p>

<H4>Input Embeddings:</H4>
The InputEmbeddings class converts input tokens into dense vectors. It uses PyTorch's nn.Embedding layer to map each token to a vector of size d_model. The vectors are then scaled by âˆš(d_model) as per the original paper.<br>
<h4>Positional Embeddings:</h4>
The PositionalEmbeddings class adds position information to the input embeddings. It creates a matrix of positional encodings using sine and cosine functions. These encodings are added to the input embeddings to give the model information about the sequence order.<br>
<h4>Layer Normalization:</h4>
The LayerNormalization class implements layer normalization, which helps stabilize the learning process. It normalizes the inputs across the features.<br>
<h4>Feed Forward Block:</h4>
The FeedForwardBlock class implements the position-wise feed-forward networks used in both the encoder and decoder. It consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.<br>
<h4>Multi-Head Attention Block:</h4>
The MultiHeadAttentionBlock class implements the multi-head attention mechanism. It projects the input into query, key, and value vectors, splits them into multiple heads, computes scaled dot-product attention, and concatenates the results.<br>
<h4>Residual Connection:</h4>
The ResidualConnection class implements the residual connections used throughout the model. It applies layer normalization, then the sublayer (attention or feed-forward), adds the result to the input, and applies dropout.<br>
<h4>Encoder Block:</h4>
The EncoderBlock class combines self-attention and feed-forward layers with residual connections to form a single encoder layer.<br>
<h4>Encoder:</h4>
The Encoder class stacks multiple encoder blocks and applies a final layer normalization.<br>
<h4>Decoder Block:</h4>
The DecoderBlock class is similar to the encoder block but includes an additional cross-attention layer that attends to the encoder output.<br>
<h4>Decoder:</h4>
The Decoder class stacks multiple decoder blocks and applies a final layer normalization.<br>
<h4>Projection Layer:</h4>
The ProjectionLayer class converts the decoder output to logits over the target vocabulary.<br>
<h4>Transformer:<h4>
The Transformer class combines all the above components into a complete model. It includes methods for encoding, decoding, and projecting.<br>
<h5>build_transformer Function:</h5>
This function is a convenient way to construct the entire Transformer model given hyperparameters like vocabulary sizes, sequence lengths, model dimension, number of layers, etc.<br>

The code follows the original Transformer architecture closely, including details like scaling the embeddings, using layer normalization, and initializing parameters with Xavier uniform initialization.<br></P>
